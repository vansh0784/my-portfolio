            >I'm a dedicated MERN stack developer with a strong grasp of Data Structures and Algorithms, which allows me to write efficient and scalable code. I have hands-on experience in building full-stack web applications using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js, and I take pride in writing clean, maintainable code. My problem-solving mindset is backed by consistent practice of algorithms and participation in coding challenges, which sharpens my logical thinking.

            Beyond technical skills, I have a constant drive to learn and explore new technologies. Whether it's trying out a new framework, diving into system design, or understanding backend architecture more deeply, I always strive to expand my knowledge base. I enjoy collaborating on projects, brainstorming solutions, and turning ideas into functional products. As someone who values growth and innovation, Iâ€™m always on the lookout for opportunities that challenge me and help me contribute meaningfully to impactful tech solutions.</p>
