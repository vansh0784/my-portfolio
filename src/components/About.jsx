              , a Software Developer and pre-final year B.Tech student. I
              specialize in the MERN stack and have an intermediate
              understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms, which helps me
              build scalable and optimized solutions. My development journey
              involves crafting full-stack applications with clean,
              maintainable code and a focus on performance and usability. I
              regularly sharpen my problem-solving skills through coding
              challenges and keep expanding my knowledge by exploring system
              design, backend architecture, and emerging technologies. I thrive
              in collaborative environments, enjoy transforming ideas into
              functional products, and am constantly driven by curiosity and
              growth. My goal is to build impactful solutions and grow as a
              developer with every project I take on.
